## Research Philosophy

I believe in the power of interdisciplinary approaches to solve complex scientific problems. By combining theoretical insights with cutting-edge computational techniques, I aim to contribute to advancements in our understanding of fundamental physics while also pushing the boundaries of machine learning applications. The current hype of machine learning is exciting, but as a physicist I am particularly interested in how these methods can be grounded in first principles and lead to interpretable results.
