## Research Philosophy

Due to my background in physics, I am always driven by a desire to understand the underlying principles of systems. Initially, this led me to study fundamental particles and forces. Over time, I have become increasingly interested in how complex behaviours emerge from simpler components, which has drawn me towards machine learning and neuroscience. In simple words: no matter how well we know fundamental laws, there is always more to learn about how they give rise to the rich phenomena we observe in nature.

Apart from that, I strongly believe that machine learning has the potential to revolutionize scientific research by enabling us to analyse vast datasets and uncover patterns that would be otherwise inaccessible. By combining my knowledge of physics with advanced computational techniques, I aim to contribute to this exciting frontier of research.

## Future Directions

As I look ahead to my PhD studies, I am excited to explore the following research directions:

1. **Neuroscience**: Investigating neural computation and understanding learning mechanisms in the brain.
2. **Explainable AI**: Developing machine learning models that provide interpretable insights into physical processes.

I'm actively seeking PhD positions in groups working on these topics. If you know of any opportunities or would like to discuss potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to [contact me](/#contact).
