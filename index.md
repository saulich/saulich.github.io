# Welcome!

I'm Siemen Aulich, a Master's student in Physics at Georg-August-University Göttingen, Germany. My research focuses on computational and theoretical physics, particularly in the areas of particle physics and neuroscience.

## About Me

I am passionate about leveraging computational methods to solve complex problems in physics. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in theoretical concepts and practical skills in programming and data analysis. I enjoy collaborating on interdisciplinary projects that push the boundaries of our understanding of the physical world. My research experience includes working on machine learning applications in high-energy physics, specifically in event reconstruction for particle collisions. 

As I prepare to begin my PhD journey, I am particularly interested in exploring neuroscience and collaborating with research groups working on understanding how learning and cognition is made possible from neural computation.

## Current Work

**Master's Thesis**: Improving Event Reconstruction in Top Quark Pairs using Machine Learning Techniques
**Supervisor**: Dr. Katharina Behr, DESY Hamburg
**Abstract**: My thesis focuses on enhancing the accuracy of event reconstruction in top quark pair production at the LHC by leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms. The goal is to improve the identification of decay products and improve measurement precision.
