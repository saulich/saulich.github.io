# Welcome!

I'm Siemen Aulich, a Master's student in Physics at Georg-August-University Göttingen, Germany. My research focuses on computational and theoretical physics, particularly in the areas of particle physics and neuroscience.

## About Me

I am passionate about leveraging computational methods to solve complex problems in physics. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in theoretical concepts in a variety of physics domains, as well as practical skills in programming and data analysis.

While my primary focus has been on high energy physics and machine learning, I am becoming deeply interested in neuroscience and its intersection with computational techniques.

When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy hiking, running, photography, and reading fantasy novels. 


## Current Work

**Master's Thesis**: Improving Event Reconstruction in Top Quark Pairs using Machine Learning Techniques
**Supervisor**: Dr. Katharina Behr, DESY Hamburg
**Abstract**: My thesis focuses on enhancing the accuracy of event reconstruction in top quark pair production at the LHC by leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms. The goal is to improve the identification of decay products and improve measurement precision.
